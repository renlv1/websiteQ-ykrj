Among those asset management applications, bank-to-bank transfer is the most typical type. Bank-to-bank transfer requires real-time, efficient and consistent practices in the distributed system. This requires that it must be supported using technology like DPoS.',
    text45: '2. Main chain – Transactions with low frequency in large size. The main chain processes transactions with complex-structured participants whose amounts are large but frequency low. A typical case is the cross asset settlement. The two counterparties set their credit limit which will be deducted within the chain when one party asks for a cross-asset exchange (cross-chain). On the day of a regular clearing and settlement, the both chains directly carried out the total asset transfer during that period. As the clearing and settling frequency is low (one settlement per day between banks), the PoW protocol maximizes the transaction security on the main chain.',
    text46: 'The design of the Main-Side Chain hybrid requires special consideration on the "auditability" for the Side Chain. The Main Chain is PoW, therefore security is guaranteed, the side chain is DPoS, therefore it is more centralized. How to strengthen the credibility of the side chain?
